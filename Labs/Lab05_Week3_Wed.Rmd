```

Create a test-train `rsplit` object of `mlc_churn` using `initial_split()`. Use the arguments to set the proportions of the training data to be 80%. Stratify the sampling according to the `churn` variable.

a. Create a LDA model specification.
b. Create a 10-fold cross-validation split object.
c. Fit the model within each of the folds.
d. Extract the performance metrics for each fold.

Repeat the above steps, but create 10 bootstraps instead. What does the different results mean?
