Each exercise is worth 16 points.

# Exercise 1
For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.
- **Better**. The large number of observations is better because we can know more about the correlation between them. Also, the number of small predictors and large sample sizes can avoid a overfitting problem in a model.
The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.

The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

The variance of the error terms, is extremely high.
